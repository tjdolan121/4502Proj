# Description: 2-3 sentence paragraph project description - what interesting questions do
you intend to answer?

Consolidate these:

THOMAS
Is crime paired with Holiday weekends? Is crime seasonal?
What are the top 5 deadliest settings (time/place) (can we map?)
how is crime related to econonomic boom and bust?

MAX
Do violent & non-violent crime differ geographically?
Are V & NV crime trends correlated? 
What trends exist? Total? By crime type?
Do trends persist from year to year / by location?
Are crime types categorically clustered?


AARON
Is there a correlation between crime and time of year and location?
Classification - Predict crime type based on month/time of crime and location.
Classification / outlier analysis - What are dangerous and safe neighborhoods based on patterns of crime? (Crime distribution in Chicago for ex.)
Predict how much crime in the future in Chicago (based on some attributes)



# Prior Work: What prior work has been done on your idea

Because it is a public data set hosted by Google and accessible using Big Query, quite a few people have done a variety of analyses on the Chicago Crime Set. On Kaggle alone there are 495 notebooks, here are a few more interesting examples:

Here also are a few other analyses posted elsewhere:

We will be including several steps in our data mining process that we believe will help us to yield a novel analysis. We will be differentiating crime by violent and non-violent crime according to the FBI standards defined here: http://gis.chicagopolice.org/clearmap_crime_sums/crime_types.html, then include (nationwide? local?) economic data over the same time period to help us identify unique trends and relationships.
