### Description of the project
Our project employs data mining methods on the Chicago Crime public dataset, hosted by Google as part of their BigQuery project, with the goal of yielding interesting information relating to the cause, prediction, and general topography of crime in Chicago. In doing so we hope to add an unbiased and data-driven voice to the analysis of crime in Chicago.  

### Summary of the question(s) sought and the answers

Major Questions:
•	Is there a correlation between crime and local economic trends?
•	Using classification methods, can we predict based on the crime, time, and place whether an arrest will be made?
•	Crime has steadily decreased since 2002, but plateaued in 2016. Why might crime have plateaued?
•	What associations are there between locations, crime types, and crime times that will help us to identify crime hotspots and idiosyncriacies?

Answers:
•	There is no overt correlation between crime and local economic trends. However, these two are not completely unrelated as evidenced by the sudden dip identified in both trends during the months of COVID. This warrants further, more detailed analysis.
